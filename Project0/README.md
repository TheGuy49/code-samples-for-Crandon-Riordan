# Project Zero

Our projet zero was a command line banking application. The minimum 
viable product had to have 
* A login/logout
* User creation with a uniqule email/username
* Bank account associated with each user
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money (wouldn't want negative balances)
* View account balance

Beyond that we had the priveledge of working with **log4j**, **JUnit** testing, **SonarCloud** for code quality analysis, and implement the DAO design pattern. Extra features added 
were multiple user bank accounts, transfering funds between users, and 
also the ability to view transaction history.
