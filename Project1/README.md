# Project 1: Reimbursment System

This project was a reimbursment system meant to model an expense 
reimbursement system. It is used to managed the reimbursment requests 
from employees and allow managers to approve or deny the pending requests.


This project used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** on the 
front-end. We used **Bootstrap** to speed up front-end development. For the 
back-end we used **Servlets** as our controllers and **JDBC** for database 
access. 


I primarily worked in front-end technologies before Revature and 
thoroughly enjoyed this project. 

The MVP for this project was as follows:
* Employee/Manager user roles
* Employees/Managers can login/logout
* Employees have an employee homepage
* An employee can submit a request
* An employee can view all pending requests and view all resolved 
requests
* An employee can update their information
* A manager can login/logout and view the manager homepage
* A manager can approve/deny pending requests
* A manager can view pending/resolved and see who manager resolved it
* A manager can view all employees and see reimburstments by that 
employee
