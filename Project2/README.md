# Project 2: Chatterbox

This project was our first group project at Revature. We as a team had 
the task of thinking of an idea for a project, coming up with user 
stories, and implementing them. This was also the hardest project for 
those reasons. 


The major issues I had with this project was Git workflow. I believe 
this project taught me the most about Git workflow and also team 
workflow. Our team lived apart from each other so we worked remotely by 
screen sharing on Discord.


Our technology stack was as follows: 
* Java
* AWS RDS
* A Continuous Integration pipeline
* Spring MVC
* Angular
* Bootstrap
* Logging with log4j, SonarLint and SonarCloud
