# Projec 3: RideForce

Our project 3 was a group of 20+ people working on a ride sharing 
application. This ride sharing application is meant to facilitate 
communication between Revature associates to solve the logistical issue 
of getting to work without a car. The issue of getting to work without a 
car in Reston, VA is not the most walkable city. 

The technology stack is Spring Boot on the back-end and Angular on the 
front-end. We're using a microservice architecture with Spring Cloud 
Netflix. From Spring Cloud Netflix we are using Eureka and Zuul for 
service discovery and service gateway.

I am working within the Microservices team as the team lead and also the 
team lead of the User service. Our goal for this project was improving 
maintainability through unit testing and documentation. We also added 
the features of disabling accounts, setting accounts as inactive and 
authorization. Our specific microservice improved our test coverage 
exponentially. Before this specific service had zero unit tests.
