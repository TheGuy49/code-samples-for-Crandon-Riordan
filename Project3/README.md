# Project 3: RideForce

Our project 3 was a group of 20+ people working on a ride sharing 
application. This ride sharing application is meant to facilitate 
communication between Revature associates to solve the logistical issue 
of getting to work without a car. Their is an issue getting to work without a car due to the lack of walkability in Reston, VA.

The technology stack is **Spring Boot** and **Spring Security** on the back-end and **Angular** on the 
front-end. We're using a microservice architecture with **Spring Cloud 
Netflix**. From **Spring Cloud Netflix** we are using **Eureka** and **Zuul** for 
service discovery and service gateway.

I worked within the Microservices team as the team lead and also the 
team lead of the User service. Our goal for this project was improving 
maintainability through unit testing and documentation. We also added 
the features of disabling accounts, setting accounts as inactive and 
authorization. Our specific microservice improved our test coverage 
exponentially. Before this specific service had zero unit tests.
