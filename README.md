This is a repository of project code that I've touched while at 
Revature. 


Project 0 was a command line banking application using **Java**, **JDBC**, and 
**Oracle RDS**.


Project 1 was a full-stack application using vanilla **JavaScript AJAX** 
calls to **servlets** that were using **JDBC** for database access.

Project 2 was the first group project. It was a full-stack application 
that abstracted from JavaScript 
and Servlets to using **Angular** for the front-end and **Spring MVC** to set up 
a RESTful API.


Project 3 was the entire batch of 20+ associates working on a ride share 
application for Revature associates. In it we used **Angular** on the client 
side and **Spring Boot** and **Spring Security** for our back-end.
